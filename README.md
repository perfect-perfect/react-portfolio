## Description
---
This is my professional React portfolio. This will be a resource for myself and potential employers. Employers can access my previous works and determine whether I am the proper fit for the position they are looking to fill.

## Features
---
Constructed with React. Includes multiple components that conditionally render, depending on which navigation link is selected. Contains links, both in the form of list items and images. The UI is interactive and navigation is intuative. Layout was also optimized for varying screen sizes through the use of flexboxes and media queries.
